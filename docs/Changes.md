# Changes Log - AAStar CoinJar

## Version History

### v0.1.1 - Package Independence & Deployment Setup (Current)
**Date**: December 2024  
**Type**: Architecture Fix + Documentation

#### 🎯 Objectives Completed
- Fixed monorepo structure for package independence
- Created comprehensive deployment documentation
- Established proper build and development scripts

#### 📝 Changes Made
1. **Package Independence Fix**
   - Removed incorrect dependencies from root `package.json`
   - Ensured each package maintains its own `node_modules/`
   - Added root-level convenience scripts for development
   - Validated independent package installation and building

2. **Deployment Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive `Deploy.md` with full deployment guide
   - Documented individual package development workflows
   - Added Docker deployment configurations
   - Established scaling and monitoring guidelines

3. **Build System Optimization**
   - Added `pnpm -r` commands for multi-package operations
   - Created convenience scripts: `dev:backend`, `dev:frontend`, `build:all`
   - Ensured each package can be deployed independently
   - Validated monorepo structure with independent scaling

#### 🏗️ Current Project State
- **Architecture**: Confirmed monorepo with independent packages
- **Backend**: Can be deployed independently on any Node.js environment
- **Frontend**: Can be deployed independently on any static hosting
- **SDK**: Can be published independently to npm registry

#### 🎯 Impact Areas
- **Deployment**: Each package can now scale independently
- **Development**: Teams can work on packages independently
- **CI/CD**: Separate build and deployment pipelines possible
- **Maintenance**: Easier dependency management per package

### v0.1.0 - Project Initialization

#### 🏗️ Current Project State
- **Frontend**: React app with basic structure (`coinjar-demo`)
- **Backend**: Express server with API endpoints (`fake-backend`)
- **SDK**: TypeScript SDK with core logic (`aastar-sdk`)
- **Documentation**: Complete feature and planning documentation

#### 🎯 Next Phase Objectives (v0.1.1)
- Development environment setup and validation
- Core SDK structure implementation
- Backend API foundation establishment
- Initial testing framework setup

#### 📊 Metrics
- **Files Created**: 2 documentation files
- **Code Coverage**: N/A (documentation phase)
- **Test Status**: Pending implementation
- **Build Status**: Pending validation

#### 🔧 Technical Decisions
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (as per project requirements)
- **Node Version**: 23.0+ (latest LTS)
- **TypeScript**: Across all packages for type safety
- **Testing**: Jest + Playwright for comprehensive coverage
- **Deployment**: Vite for frontend, Node.js for backend

#### 🎯 Impact Areas
- **Product**: Clear roadmap established for merchant crypto payment solution
- **Development**: Structured approach with defined phases and milestones
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive foundation for team collaboration
- **Architecture**: Confirmed monorepo structure with three core packages

#### 📋 Action Items for Next Version
1. ✅ Validate development environment setup across all packages
2. Implement core AAStar SDK account creation functionality
3. ✅ Setup backend API endpoints with proper error handling
4. Create initial test suites for critical path functionality
5. Establish CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

#### 🧪 Testing Results
**Development Environment Validation**:
- ✅ pnpm package manager: Working correctly
- ✅ Node.js 23.0+: Confirmed compatible
- ✅ TypeScript configuration: All packages compile successfully

**Package Build Status**:
- ✅ `aastar-sdk`: Builds successfully with TypeScript compiler
- ✅ `coinjar-demo`: Builds successfully with Vite (549.80 kB bundle)
- ✅ `fake-backend`: Starts successfully on http://localhost:4000

**API Endpoint Testing**:
- ✅ `POST /register/start`: Returns proper challenge response
- ✅ `GET /prices`: Returns real-time crypto prices 
- ✅ `GET /history`: Returns mock transaction history
- ✅ All endpoints respond with correct JSON format

**Current System Status**:
